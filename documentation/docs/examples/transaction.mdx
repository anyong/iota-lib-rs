A [SignedTransaction](../key_concepts/messages_payloads_and_transactions.md#signedtransaction) is a core payload
type that is used to send value-based messages as [Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)](key_concepts/messages_payloads_and_transactions#unspent-transaction-output-utxo). This core payload changes the ledger state as it spends "old" outputs and replaces them with new outputs.

:::info

Though it is possible to send transactions with iota.rs, we strongly recommend that you use official
[`wallet.rs`](https://wiki.iota.org/wallet.rs/welcome) library together with the
[`stronghold.rs`](https://wiki.iota.org/stronghold.rs/welcome) enclave for value-based transfers. This combination
incorporates the best security practices while dealing with seeds, related addresses and `UTXO`.

:::note Dust Protection
There is a [dust protection](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/faq#what-is-dust-protection-and-how-does-it-work)
mechanism implemented in the network protocol to prevent malicious actors from spamming the network in an attempt to decrease node
performance while keeping track of unspent amount (`UTXO`).


"... microtransactions below 1Mi of IOTA tokens can be sent to another address if there is already at least 1Mi on that address"


That's why the code in the example sent 1Mi, to comply with the protection.
