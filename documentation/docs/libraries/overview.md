# IOTA Client Libraries

You can use the Rust version of the iota.rs client library, as well as any of the Node.js, Python, Java, and Wasm
bindings.

- [Rust](rust/getting_started.md).
- [Node.js](nodejs/getting_started.md).
- [Python](python/getting_started.md).
- [Java](java/getting_started.md).
- [Wasm](wasm/getting_started.md).

## Getting Started

If you are not familiar with the libraries, you should start your interactions with IOTA on a
[devnet network](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/devnet).

You can find a network explorer at [IOTA Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/devnet).

To properly test value-based transactions on devnet network, you are going to need some tokens. You can get
some devnet tokens using the [faucet](https://faucet.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe/). However, if you plan on using of
value-based IOTA transfers, we strongly recommend you use the official 
[wallet.rs](https://wiki.iota.org/wallet.rs/welcome) library.
