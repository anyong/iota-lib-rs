#### Client.findOutputs(output_ids (optional), addresses (optional))

The function [`Client.findOutputs()`](api_reference#findoutputsoutputids-addresses-promiseoutputmetadata) is a convenient
shortcut combining both [`Client.getAddressOutputs(str)`](api_reference#getaddressoutputsaddress-options-promisestring)
and [`Client.getOutput(str)`](api_reference#getoutputoutputid-promise) methods in a single call. It supports two
arguments, a list of `output_ids` or a list of [`addresses`](api_reference#address).

**Output example**:

```json
[
  {
    "messageId": "f303bc90a5ed3ef15af5fc6aa81a739978c59458a71e68ce8e380f1f534da1e6",
    "transactionId": "0f2d5d2651f8061a9f5417d0658009f32b2e3f77f9706b0be3b4b3f466171f36",
    "outputIndex": 0,
    "isSpent": false,
    "address": "atoi1qzt0nhsf38nh6rs4p6zs5knqp6psgha9wsv74uajqgjmwc75ugupx3y7x0r",
    "amount": 1000000
  },
  {
    "messageId": "825266a79c0ffb6001ed263eb150357863b7d0052627c5766e8ef5acd6fed533",
    "transactionId": "768c20c15a290e02a43b83263a98501b9d7eb0b57da40a9247289c672de63ea6",
    "outputIndex": 0,
    "isSpent": false,
    "address": "atoi1qzt0nhsf38nh6rs4p6zs5knqp6psgha9wsv74uajqgjmwc75ugupx3y7x0r",
    "amount": 1000000
  }
]
```

* `message_id`: Refers to the encapsulating message in which the transaction was sent.
* `transaction_id`, `output_index`: Refers to the output within the `SignedTransaction` payload. There may be several
`outputs` involved in a single transaction, so the `transaction_id` by itself would not be enough.
* `output`: This section provides details about the iota address to which the given
[unspent transaction output](#unspent-transaction-output-utxo) is
coupled with.
* `amount`: States an amount of tokens related to the `output`.
* `is_spent`: Indicates whether the given `output` is a part of the actual ledger state or not. As mentioned in the
[Unspent Transaction Output section](#unspent-transaction-output-utxo), if an output was already spent it is not part
of the ledger state any more and is replaced by some other `output(s)` in the process.

Notice that the `output_id` that was used in a function call to get output details is the same as a combination of the
`transaction_id` and `output index`. This way a transaction is tightly coupled with `outputs` since the
`SignedTransaction` payload is a main vehicle to create and spend `outputs`, and everything is encapsulated in a
[`message`](api_reference#message).
