:::note

You can use the [faucet service](https://faucet.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe/)  to send test tokens to any Chrysalis
[devnet](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/devnet) address.

:::

There are three common API calls you can use to get a balance:

* `Client.get_address_balance(address: str)`: It expects a single address in Bech32 format and returns `dict` with a balance for the address.
* `Client.get_address_balances(list[str])`: A convenient function that expects `list` of addresses in Bech32 format and returns list of `dict` with balances for all given addresses
* `Client.get_balance(seed, account_index (optional), initial_address_index(optional), gap_limit(optional))`: A convenient function that combines `Client.get_addresses()` and `Client.get_address_balances()` api calls. It returns a combined balance for the provided `seed` and optional chaining calls `.accountIndex(index)`, `.initialAddressIndex(index)` and `.gapLimit(amount)`

<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">
  {get_balance}
</CodeBlock>

Example of output:

```json
{
   "address":"atoi1qp9427varyc05py79ajku89xarfgkj74tpel5egr9y7xu3wpfc4lkpx0l86",
   "balance":10000000,
   "dustAllowed":false
}
Account balance: 0
```

* `dustAllowed` indicates whether the given address is allowed to accept a dust due to
[dust protection mechanism](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/faq#what-is-dust-protection-and-how-does-it-work).

`Client.get_balance(seed)` performs several tasks under the hood. It starts by generating addresses for the provided
`seed` and `.account_index` from `.initial_address_index`, and checks for a balance of each of the generated
addresses. Since it does not know how many addresses are used in fact, there is a condition set by the
`.gap_limit` argument to know when to stop searching. If the `gap_limit` amount of addresses in a row have no
balance, the function returns results and stops searching.
