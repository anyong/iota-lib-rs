## Requirements

This is a rust library, if you don't have rust installed yet, visit [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Using the library

Using the library is very easy, you just need to add it as dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

<!-- 
<CodeBlock className="language-toml">
    [dependencies]
    iota-client = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs", branch = "develop" }
    tokio = { version = "1.20.0", features = [ "full" ] }
</CodeBlock> -->

## Example

This example fetches node information

<CodeBlock className="language-rust">
    use iota_client::{Client, Result};

    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() -> Result<()> {
        // Create a client with that node.
        let client = Client::builder()
            .with_node("https://api.alphanet.iotaledger.net/")?
            .with_node_sync_disabled()
            .finish()?;

        // Get node info.
        let info = client.get_info().await?;

        // Print node info.
        println!("{info:#?}");

        Ok(())
    }
</CodeBlock>
