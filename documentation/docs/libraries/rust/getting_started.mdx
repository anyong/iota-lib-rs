import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

## Requirements

This is a rust library, if you don't have rust installed yet, visit [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Using the library

Using the library is very easy, you just need to add it as dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
[dependencies]
iota-client = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs", branch = "develop" }
tokio = { version = "1.20.0", features = [ "full" ] }
```

## Example

This example fetches node information

```rust
use iota_client::{Client, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Create a client with that node.
    let client = Client::builder()
        .with_node("https://api.testnet.shimmer.network")?
        .with_node_sync_disabled()
        .finish()?;

    // Get node info.
    let info = client.get_info().await?;

    // Print node info.
    println!("{info:#?}");

    Ok(())
}
```
