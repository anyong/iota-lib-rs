Since the IOTA network is permission-less, anybody is able to use it and interact with it. No central authority is
required at any stage. So anybody is able to generate their own `seed` and then deterministically generate the
respective private keys/addresses.

:::info

Please note, it is highly recommended that you avoid using online seed generators. The seed is the only key to the given
addresses. So, anyone who owns the seed also owns all the funds related to respective IOTA addresses.

:::warning
Though it is possible to send transactions with iota.rs, we strongly recommend that you use official
[`wallet.rs`](https://wiki.iota.org/wallet.rs/welcome) library together with the
[`stronghold.rs`](https://wiki.iota.org/stronghold.rs/welcome) enclave for value-based transfers. This combination
incorporates the best security practices while dealing with seeds, related addresses and `UTXO`.
:::

IOTA uses the `Ed25519` signature scheme and addresses are usually represented by Bech32 (checksummed base32) format
string of 64 characters.

A root of the `Ed25519` signature scheme is basically a `32-byte (256-bit)` uniformly randomly generated seed
on which all private keys and corresponding addresses are generated. In the examples below, the seed is represented by
a string of 64 characters using the `[0-9a-f]` alphabet (32 bytes encoded in hexadecimal).

You can generate a seed, for example, using the SHA256 algorithm on some random input generated by a cryptographically
secure pseudo-random generator, such as `crypto.randomBytes()`:

<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">
  {generate_seed}
</CodeBlock>

:::info
In modern wallet implementations such as the [wallet.rs library](https://wiki.iota.org/wallet.rs/welcome) and the
[firefly wallet](https://blog.iota.org/firefly-beta-release/), the seed is usually generated from a `seed mnemonic`
(`seed phrase`), using [BIP39 standard](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0039), to be better memorized/stored by humans.
It is based on a randomly generated list of english words and later used to generate the seed. The seed is a root for
all generated private keys and addresses.
