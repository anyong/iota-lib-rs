You can generate an IOTA address using the `AddressGetter` helper class and calling the `Client.getAddresses()` function
and respective chaining calls that will return a list of tuples with the generated addresses. You can find more information
on the parameters in the [Address/Key Space section](../../../key_concepts/address_key_space.md).

:::note
The examples use an example seed `b3d7092195c36d47133ff786d4b0a1ef2ee6a0052f6e87b6dc337935c70c531e` is
stored in an environment variable called `IOTA_SEED_SECRET`. This seed serves for training purposes only.
:::

The whole process is deterministic. This means the output is the same as long as the seed is the same:

<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">
  {generate_addresses}
</CodeBlock>

**Output example**:

```string
[
  'atoi1qz6dr6dtl0856tf0pczz7gesrf7j8a4vr00q58ld2zx7ttlv3p96snpym9z',
  'atoi1qpp7sz28a0ghvd6knwnljr7j2s04qquduuc5vlz94fwf94zznj2yv5ew2c4',
  'atoi1qzje6zhg5vu456eg3z84ekcfn3laxqyczche5eeqhcdh3w9yr5sqvr4z4td',
  'atoi1qqwhxjmcvmatpedeedapgx0vwyupfwx9k5n4w0lnc5l6vmz78aavwhs55v0',
  'atoi1qzg63t9880jtfysvpq7rrynz0rqt3kd2fw8r4934ezraz9dpwvzxkw2dtmh'
]
```

IOTA addresses are represented by a checksumed base-32 string (Bech32). You can find a detailed explanation in the
[Chrysalis documentations](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/guides/developer/#iota-15-address-anatom), but here are
parts relevant to this example:

* If an address starts with `atoi` then it means it is related to `devnet`. `iota` stands for `mainnet`.
* Number `1` at the 5<sup>th</sup> position is just a separator.
* The last 6 characters are reserved for a checksum.

Addresses can be also represented in a hex format and `iota.rs` provides some convenient functions to convert addresses:
`Client.bech32ToHex(bech32)`and
`Client.hexToBech32(hex, bech32_hrp (optional))`.

If you want to quickly validate any IOTA address, you can use the
`Client.isAddressValid()` function that returns a `bool` value. You should
perform a sanity check on address before using it.
