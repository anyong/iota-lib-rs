# Welcome

The iota.rs library is a library that handles communications between your software and the IOTA network. 

The iota.rs library is free and open-source, and it will always stay so. Both the IOTA Foundation and the community of IOTA enthusiasts maintain the wiki and this wiki section, meaning that you can rely on it as a source of knowledge on iota.rs. Start exploring it from the [Overview](overview.md) page.

If you have questions, jump into a discussion or start a new one on our [Discord](https://discord.iota.org) server. Take a look at our [community](https://iota.stackexchange.com/) on Stack Exchange, too: this website is designed to ask questions and find answers. If you wish to contribute, we have a [guide](./contribute.md) for that, too.

We are glad that you are here!
