## Requirements

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org).
* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip).

## Install package from PyPI

You can install the library by executing `pip install iota-client`.

## Install from source

:::caution

We recommend to install the library with [pip from PyPI](#install-package-from-pypi). 
Only compile the library from source if you are in need of some unreleased features or are working with an unsupported computer architecture.

:::

### Additional Requirements

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
* (for Linux only) `libudev`. You can install it with `apt install libudev-dev`.

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the [iota.rs client library](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs) by running the following command:

```bash
git clone -b develop https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs
```

### Change to the Python Binding Directory

After you have cloned the repository, you should change directory to `iota.rs/client/bindings/python`. You can do so by
running the following command:

```bash
cd iota.rs/client/bindings/python
```

### Install the Required Dependencies and Build the Wheel

Once you have [cloned the repository](#clone-the-repository),
and [moved to the binding's directory](#change-to-the-python-binding-directory), you should install dependencies and build the wheel file.

You can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install .
```

### (optional) Create and Use a Virtual Environment

If you want to isolate the library from the rest of your system, you can create a virtual environment by running the
following commands:

#### Linux/MacOs

```bash
python3 -m venv iota_client_venv
source iota_client_venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```shell
.\iota_client_venv\Scripts\activate
```

### (optional) Deactivate the virtual environment

If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, you should run the following command from the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Use the Library

After you installed the library, you can create a `IotaClient` instance and interface with it.

```python
from iota_client import IotaClient

# Create an IotaClient instance
client = IotaClient({'nodes': ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network']})

# Get the node info
node_info = client.get_info()
print(f'{node_info}')
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/00_run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples).

## Use with IOTA library

:::info

As Python doesn't support using multiple versions of the same library, if you want to use both the Shimmer and IOTA version, you need to build one of them yourself and rename it.

:::

In this section we will show you an Example on how you can install both the IOTA and Shimmer client for usage in the same application.
For that we will build the IOTA client library ourselfes and rename it.

### Install Shimmer version

First install the Shimmer version following the [installation guide](#install-package-from-pypi).

### Install IOTA version

To install the IOTA version you need to follow the [Install from source](https://wiki.iota.org/iota.rs/getting_started/python#install-from-source) guide.
Before you continue with the steps after having cloned the repo, we need to apply some changes to the repo first. 

:::info

In this guide we will rename the `iota-client` to `iota-client-production`, but you can use whatever you want.

:::

In `bindings/python/native/Cargo.toml` change both names:

```diff
  [package]
- name = "iota-client-python"
+ name = "iota-client-production"
  version = "0.2.0-alpha.3"
  authors = ["IOTA Stiftung"]
  edition = "2021"
  description = "Python bindings for the IOTA client library"
  documentation = "https://wiki.iota.org/iota.rs/welcome"
  homepage = "https://www.iota.org/"
  repository = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs"
  license = "Apache-2.0"
  keywords = ["iota", "tangle", "client", "python"]
  categories = ["cryptography::cryptocurrencies"]

[lib]
- name = "iota_client"
+ name = "iota_client_production"
  crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

In `bindings/python/native/setup.py`:
```diff
setup(
-   name="iota_client",
+   name="iota_client_production"
    version="0.1.0",
    classifiers=[
        "License :: SPDX-License-Identifier ::  Apache-2.0",
        "Development Status :: 0.1.0 - Alpha",
        "Intended Audience :: Developers",
        "Programming Language :: Python",
        "Programming Language :: Rust",
        "Operating System :: POSIX",
        "Operating System :: MacOS :: MacOS X",
    ],
    packages=["iota_client"],
    rust_extensions=[
        RustExtension(
            "iota_client.iota_client",
            rustc_flags=get_py_version_cfgs(),
            debug=False,
        ),
    ],
    include_package_data=True,
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

And in `bindings/python/native/src/lib.rs`:
```diff
/// A Python module implemented in Rust.
#[pymodule]
- fn iota_client(_py: Python<'_>, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
+ fn iota_client_production(_py: Python<'_>, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
      m.add_class::<Client>()?;
      Ok(())
  }
```

Now you can continue the installation from [here](https://wiki.iota.org/iota.rs/getting_started/python#change-to-the-python-binding-directory).

### Usage

With both libraries installed you can now use them for example like this:

```python
import json

from iota_client import IotaClient as ShimmerClient # Imported as ShimmerClient to prevent confusion
import iota_client_production

# Create an IotaClient instance
shimmer_client = ShimmerClient({'nodes': ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network']})

# Get and print the node info
print(f'{json.dumps(shimmer_client.get_info(), indent=4)}')

# create a client with a node
iota_client = iota_client_production.Client(
    nodes_name_password=[['https://api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe']])

print(f'{json.dumps(iota_client.get_info(), indent=4)}')
```
