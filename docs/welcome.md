# Welcome

This documentation site describes the iota.rs library, a library that handles communications between your application and the IOTA network. Start learning from the [Overview](./overview.md) page. We have a large community of IOTA enthusiasts on our [Discord](https://discord.iota.org) server, the best place to join the discussion and ask questions. Take a look at our [Stack Exchange](https://iota.stackexchange.com/), too.

The iota.rs library is free and open-source. We welcome everyone who is willing to [contribute](./contribute.md).

We are glad that you are here!
