# Welcome

This documentation site describes the IOTA client library, a library that handles communications between your application and the IOTA network. Start learning from the [Overview](./overview) page, join the community on [Discord](https://discord.iota.org), or maybe even [contribute](./contribute.md) to the project.

We are glad that you are here!
