# IOTA Client libraries

There are currently available the following official bindings to `iota.rs`:

- [Rust](./rust/) 
- [Node.js](./nodejs/) 
- [Python](./python/) 

## Getting Started
It is a recommended approach to start your interactions with IOTA on a `testnet` network. API load balancer: https://api.lb-0.testnet.chrysalis2.com:443

Network explorer is available at [IOTA Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/chrysalis).

In order to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens! You can get some testnet tokens using the [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.chrysalis2.com/). However, we strongly recommend to leverage official [wallet.rs](https://wallet-lib.docs.iota.org/) library in case of value-based IOTA transfers.
