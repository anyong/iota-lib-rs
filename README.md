# iota.rs

Official Rust library.  

> **ðŸš§ Alpha Version ðŸš§**
>
> This repository now targets [Chrysalis part 2](https://roadmap.iota.org/chrysalis) It will have many breaking change along the way. Please use with caution! ðŸš§

The goal of this library is to have `one source code of truth`, which means there is one implementation in Rust and [bindings](#bindings) to other programming languages.

For value transfers we recommend to use [wallet.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs).

This **alpha** version allows you to do the following:

* Create messages and transactions
* Sign transactions
* Generate addresses
* Interact with an IOTA node

Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/issues).

## Requirements

To use the library, we recommend you update Rust to latest stable version [`$ rustup update stable`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date). Nightly should be fine but some changes might not be compatible.

`no_std` is not currently supported, but we are working on it in [bee](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee), and will provide it as feature once the new implementation is ready.

## Using the library

Using the library is easy, just add it as dependancy in `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
[dependencies]
iota-core = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs", branch = "dev" }
```

And then you can use the library in your code with `iota`.

When using the "MQTT" feature, connecting to a MQTT broker using raw ip doesn't work. This is a limitation of rustls.

## API reference

You can read the [API reference](https://docs.rs/iota-core) here, or generate it yourself.

If you'd like to explore the implementation in more depth, the following command generates docs for the whole crate, including private modules:

```bash
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```

## Examples

You can see the examples in the [examples](examples/) directory and try them with:

```bash
cargo run --example balance
```

For the examples where a seed is required you have to rename `.env.example` to `.env`.

## Bindings

Bindings to other programming languages.

* [Node.js binding](bindings/nodejs/)
* [Python binding](bindings/python/)

## Supporting the project
