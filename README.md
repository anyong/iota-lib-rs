This is the **WIP** Rust client library, which allows you to do the following:
* Create transactions
* Sign transactions
* Generate addresses
* Interact with an IRI node

This client library is still in the beta stage, so there may be performance and stability issues. As IOTA Foundation currently working on `bee`, we also decided to re-implement common libraries for security. This library is going to be feature freeze untill fundamental crates are done.
Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/issues).

## Prerequisites

To use the library, we recommend update your Rust to latest stable version [`rustup update stable`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date). Nightly should be fine but you are expected some changes might not be compatable.

`no_std` is not supported currently, but we are working on it in [bee](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee), and will provide it as feature once new library implementation is ready.

## Using the library

Using the library is fairly easy, just add it as dependancy in `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
iota-lib-rs = "0.4"
```

## Getting started

After you've [installed the library](#installing-the-library),  you can connect to an IRI node to send transactions to it and interact with the ledger.

To connect to a local IRI node, we provide a module `Client` :

```rust
use iota_lib_rs::prelude::*;

let mut iota = iota_client::Client::new("https://localhost");

println!("{:#?}", iota.get_node_info().unwrap);
```


## API reference

For details on all available API methods, see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/iota-lib-rs).

## Examples

```rust
use iota_client::options::SendTransferOptions;
use iota_lib_rs::prelude::*;
use iota_model::Transfer;
use iota_conversion::trytes_converter;

fn main() {
    let trytes =
        "HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDD";
    let message = trytes_converter::to_trytes("Hello World").unwrap();
    let transfer = Transfer {
        address: trytes.to_string(),
        // Don't need to specify the field 
        // because the field and variable
        // have the same name
        message,
        // Populate the rest of the fields with default values
        ..Transfer::default()
    };
    let mut api = iota_client::Client::new("https://node01.iotatoken.nl");
    let tx = api
        .send_transfers(
            transfer,
            &trytes,
            SendTransferOptions {
                local_pow: true,
                threads: 2,
                ..SendTransferOptions::default()
            },
        )
        .unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", tx);
}
```
