# iota.rs

Official Rust library.  

> **ðŸš§ Alpha Version ðŸš§**
>
> This repository now targets [Chrysalis part 2](https://roadmap.iota.org/chrysalis) It will have many breaking change along the way. Please use with caution! ðŸš§

The goal of this library is to have `one source code of truth`, which means there is one implementation in Rust and [bindings](#bindings) to other programming languages.

This **alpha** version allows you to do the following:
* Create messages and transactions
* Sign transactions
* Generate addresses
* Interact with an IOTA node

Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/issues).

## Requirements

To use the library, we recommend you update Rust to latest stable version [`$ rustup update stable`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date). Nightly should be fine but some changes might not be compatible.

`no_std` is not currently supported, but we are working on it in [bee](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee), and will provide it as feature once the new implementation is ready.

### Dependencies

`cmake` and `openssl` are required. In order to run the build process succesfully using Cargo you might need install additional build tools on your system. 

### Windows

`cmake` can be downloaded on the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/) and `openssl` can be installed with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

- Installing `openssl` with `vcpkg`:

```
$ ./vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
$ ./vcpkg.exe integrate install
# you may want to add this to the system environment variables since you'll need it to compile the crate
$ set VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=1
```

- Installing `openssl` with `chocolatey`:

```
$ choco install openssl
# you may need to set the OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR environment variable
$ set OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64"
```

### macOS

`cmake` and `openssl` can be installed with `Homebrew`:

```
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install openssl@1.1
# you may want to add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc since you'll need it to compile the crate
$ OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)
```

### Linux

Install `cmake` and `openssl` with your distro's package manager or download from their websites. On Debian and Ubuntu you will also need `build-essential`.

## Using the library

Using the library is easy, just add it as dependancy in `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
iota-core = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs", branch = "dev" }
```

And then you can use the library in your code with `iota`.

## API reference

You can read the [API reference](https://docs.rs/iota-core) here, or generate it yourself.

If you'd like to explore the implementation in more depth, the following command generates docs for the whole crate, including private modules:

```
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```

## Examples

You can see the examples in the [examples](examples/) directory and try them with:

```
cargo run --example balance
```

For the examples where a seed is required you have to rename `.env.example` to `.env`.

## Bindings

Bindings to other programming languages.

- [Node.js binding](bindings/node/)
