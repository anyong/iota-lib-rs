# Welcome
This is the documentation for the official IOTA Client Library. It can be used to easily interact with IOTA network (Tangle) via [IOTA node software](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/node-software/node-software.html). Official IOTA libraries serve as `one-source-code-of-truth` to IOTA users and providing binding to other programming languages. You can read more about core principles behind IOTA client libraries in the following blog [post](https://blog.iota.org/the-new-iota-client-libraries-harder-better-faster-stronger/).

Example of tasks that `iota.rs` is able to help with:
- Create messages and transactions
- Sign transactions
- Generate addresses
- Interact with an IOTA node

> Please note: there is also available `wallet.rs` library that contains all the logic to safely build wallets or integrations that require value-based IOTA transfers. We strongly recommend to leverage [wallet.rs library](https://wallet-lib.docs.iota.org/) in case one is more focused on IOTA value-based transfers since it integrates the best security practices including our [stronghold enclave](https://blog.iota.org/iota-stronghold-6ce55d311d7c/).

## Changes from IOTA 1.0 to 1.5
